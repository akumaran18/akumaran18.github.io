            <div><p>Twin City Photography was founded by two friends studying in the photography department at UIUC in 2001. We wanted to create a wonderful service that offered a variety of high quality prints and other media to the public at reasonable prices. Most of all, we wanted to create a real connection with our customers and make photoshoots fun, relaxed, and sucessful in capturing their most cherished memories. 17 years on we believe we are fulfilling this mission everyday with our work and have been changing the way people think about photoshoots all over Champaign-Urbana.</p><br><br><br>
            <p>Amrutha is currently getting a certificate in interactive design from Parkland College and she has really enjoyed building Twin City Photography over the years. In her free time she thinks up new ideas for her stained glass art projects and likes to read when she gets the chance.</p></div>
